# Image Clipboard support

On Mac its a little tricky to get things into the clipboard and there may be better solutions by the time you read this, so go search again.

## The Program

For the time being since good old `pbcopy` is less than perfect there is a `.m` file here in this folder that can help. The instructions for installation are within the file.

## The Action

If you have an image somewhere that you need on your clipboard you can just

```bash
impbcopy $SS_PATH
```
